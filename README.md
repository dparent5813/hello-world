# hello-world
My first repository
I have been an engineer for 29 years and over the course of my career, my fondest memories are sharing my passion for technology with others, especially a younger generation. It is my ten-year goal to inspire a younger generation to solve challenging problems by combining hands-on skills with a broad technology background.
